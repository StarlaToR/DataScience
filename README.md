<h1> Data Analysis Project </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

This is a Python project made by Matéo Erbisti, Lenny Rabinne, and Antoine Mordant at ISART DIGITAL Paris.
Its goal is to respond to the question: What are the most popular video game genres in the world?

<h2> Process </h2>

<h3> Data research </h3>

We searched for datasets on video game sales in the last few years, depending on the geographic zone.

The most accurate ones we found are on Kaggle.

We found :
 - Video game sales between 1976 and 2016
 - Steam game sales during March 2025
 - Mobile game sales 2010-2021
 - Metacritic data

<h3> Data preprocessing </h3>

We cleaned our dataset to use proper data for our analysis.

<h3> Analysis </h3>

We studied video game genre sales by region and by year.

<h2> How to use our work </h2>

We used different Python libraries :
 - numpy
 - pandas
 - streamlit

<h3> Streamlit </h3>

To run our Streamlit platform, you have to run the command :

 streamlit run ./Home.py

<h3> Notebooks </h3>

Our notebooks run under Jupyter. It's where you can find our different graphs.
